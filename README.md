## Getting Started

To begin working with this project, you need to have Java installed on your computer, preferably JDK 8 or later. Alternatively, you can use the NetBeans IDE version 8.2. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

### Installing Java

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website or use a package manager for your operating system.

- **For Windows:**
  - Download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use the provided NetBeans bundle.
  - If you choose to install the JDK separately, download it from [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
  - Follow the installation wizard instructions.

- **For Linux:**
  - Use your distribution's package manager to install Java. For example:
    - For Debian/Ubuntu:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install default-jdk
      ```
    - For Arch Linux:
      ```bash
      sudo pacman -S jdk-openjdk
      ```
    - For Red Hat/Fedora:
      ```bash
      sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
      ```
  - Alternatively, you can download the JDK from [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Installing NetBeans

If you prefer using the NetBeans IDE, you can download it from the provided link below:

- Download NetBeans IDE 8.2 from [here](https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2).

##### For Windows:

- If you are running on an AMD or INTEL x86 computer, install `jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-x64.exe`.
- Run the installation wizard and follow the instructions.

##### For Linux:

- Download NetBeans using your respective distribution package manager. For example, use APT, PACMAN, YUM, or ZYPPER.
  ```bash
  # Example for Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install netbeans

- Alternatively, you can download the Linux installer script from here (e.g.,`` jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-linux-x64.sh``). Change the script permissions using chmod +x.  Execute the script using ``./jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-linux-x64.sh.``

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow the guidelines below:    

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```
3. Create a new branch for the feature you want to develop. Use the format `surname_feature-name`:

    ```bash
    # example
    git checkout -b sarmiento_crazyFeature
    ```
    
    * If the repo is on your local machine fetch the `main` branch to update any changes
     ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
4. As much as possible write code following the [Javadoc documentation style.](https://www.oracle.com/ph/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#format) to help other contributors  & members understand the functionality.
    ```
    /**
    * Brief description of the function or class.
    *
    * @param parameter1 Description of parameter1.
    * @param parameter2 Description of parameter2.
    * @return Description of the return value.
    * @throws SomeException If applicable, describe the exception.
    */
    public ReturnType functionName(Type parameter1, Type parameter2) throws SomeException {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
    ```
5. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m 'Add detailed description of changes'
    ```

6. Push your branch to your forked repository:

    ```bash
        git push origin your-surname_feature-name
    ```
7. Create a pull request:
    - Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
    - Click on "New Pull Request."
    - Select the branch you just created.
    - Provide a clear and concise summary of your changes.
